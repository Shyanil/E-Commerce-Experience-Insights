# E-Commerce Experience Insights


## Project Overview
 You have been contracted by an e-commerce company based in New York City that specializes in selling clothing online. The company also offers in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers can meet with personal stylists in-store and then order their desired clothes through either the mobile app or the website.

The primary goal of this project is to help the company decide whether to focus their efforts on improving the mobile app experience or the website. By analyzing customer data and utilizing a linear regression model with scikit-learn, we will uncover insights about user preferences and behavior.
